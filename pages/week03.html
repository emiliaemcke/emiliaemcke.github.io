    <h1>Reading Response</h1>

        <h2>Long Ling the Web</h2>
        <p>In an interview yesterday for an innovation firm,  I was asked what a field is that I would consider ripe for innovation. While a million industries came to mind, one of the topics which I deal with most regularly is the internet. Specifically the social aspect of the internet.
        The text, “Long Live the Web” reminded me of my reasoning for indicating social interactions on the internet are ripe for change.
        As the text mentions, “the Web is also vital to democracy, a communications channel that makes possible a continuous world- wide conversation”. Since its development the web has shaped our form of communication through social media and other internet sites as a global platform for free expression and conversation. It has made it possible “that any person could share information with anyone else, anywhere”. As the internet has changed the way we communicate, it has not adjusted itself to our new methods. For example, conventional social media platforms have remained relatively stagnant since their original launch. Hence, the possibility for disruption. 
        This quote from “Long Live the Web” stood out to me in particular:

    “Now is an exciting time. Web developers, companies, governments and citizens should work together openly and cooperatively, as we have done thus far, to preserve the Web’s fundamental principles, as well as those of the Internet, ensuring that the technological protocols and social conventions we set up respect basic human values”.

        <h2>As We May Think</h2>
         <p>In the reading, “As We May Think”, what interested me the most of the idea of communication. Though the concept of communication was specifically related to technology, data, information and data collection, I think the interesting discussion revolves around the necessity of interconnected and continuity in order to create and innovate. 
        For example, though we may think of the mathematician as someone specialized in numbers, there are many other components that make his ability to solve complex problems relevant for practical use. One of the examples that the text used which stood out to me was 
        The use of a the vocoder and the stenotype which singularly act in one way, but as a unit creates a machine that types when it is spoken to. This type of innovation is reliant on interconnectedness and communication. This is something that was relevant in the previously mentioned reading and my idea that social platforms on the web need to develop for more exciting and interactive communication and innovation.
