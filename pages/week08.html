    <h2>3 Examples: Tension between the means and the message</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div class="left" style="background-color:#f1a9a9;">
    Global Warming 
    <br>
    According to the progress report in 2019, the most urgent area for action is climate change. If we do not cut greenhouse gas emissions now, global warming is projected to reach 1.5°C in the coming decades. Much like the SDGs indicate the interlinkage between the biosphere and society is likely to fall apart. The compounded effects will be devastating. If climate action isn’t taken, the effects will render parts of the globe uninhabitable, adversely affecting the poor, damaging food production and hunger, depleting clean water sources, and much more.
    Yet when we think of climate change, we often abstract ourselves from the message that the carbon emissions are sending, and namely that we are a huge part of the problem. In this scenario while the global warming is the message, we are the meaning behind it and the reason why it is so much more worse in the last 50 years.

    Tracy Emin 
    <br>
    When Tracy Emin created her famous art piece “My Bed” her method of portraying her battle with depression, her womanhood and her alcohol abuse shocked art critics throughout the world. Her contemporary work was described as vulgar and disgusting. 
    <br>
    When McCLUHAN says “What is the content of speech?,” it is necessary to say, “It is an actual process of thought, which is in itself nonver- bal”, I had to think of Tracy Emin’s work. The method of her work was a sculpture consisting of her bed, bottles of alcohol, tampons, blood stained sheets, tissues and cigarettes. Yet, what many critics failed to see was the thought behind the choice to display her actual bed as a work of art. Emin’s work inevitable created a tension with how people viewed art and even further how they expected women to act. More importantly, it had the effect of opening up a dialogue about the challenges that Emit, much like many other women deal with.

    Twitter 
    <br>
    Twitter has created a dichotomy in society. It can be used for good and it can be used for bad, yet the conversation still remains whether the problem is in the platform or in the people who use it. 

    “We are too prone to make technological instruments the scapegoats for the sins of those who wield them. The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.” 
    This sentence reminded me of the debate on how twitter can be used, and who is to blame for the power it has. On the one hand, in the arab springs uprising, we saw how twitter is able to be used to single handedly take down a dictatorship, while at the same time it can be used to spread fake news, and perpetuate false narratives as seen during the US election and throughout Trumps presidency. So here again the question arises, is it the means or the message that should be held accountable?
