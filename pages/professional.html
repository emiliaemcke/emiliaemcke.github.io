                <p>This summer, I interned at Planetly, a climate-tech startup, in Berlin, developing a data-driven software that analyses CO2 emissions for businesses. Planetly’s product was in its Beta-phase, which meant
                    reassessing the development of the product to match the needs of our clients. During my time, I was responsible for collecting and reacting to client feedback. This taught me to master the iterative process
                    and to adapt quickly to changing environments. I applied this when reaching out to my network, to pitch
                    Planetly’s product, acquiring a Hamburg-based capital holdings group as one of their first pilot clients.</p>

                    I was thrilled when I was able to apply these learnings at BLOX, a Copenhagen, Denmark, based
                    company engaged in sustainable urban development. Here, I am responsible for organizing workshops
                    with ambassadors and local politicians in Latin America to understand their respective urban challenges
                    and come up with synergistic solutions. At BLOX I learned that developing solutions requires the ability
                    to point out not only obvious issues but also tangential ones.</p>

                    After interning in Copenhagen, I moved to Madrid to intern at Qualitas Equity, a private equity firm investing in renewable energy throughout Spain. At Qualitas, I was responsible for developing an ESG strategy as well as writting an ESG report. Through extensive due dilligence processes with potential investors, I was able to learn very quickly what ESG components matter to investors and create realistic yet ambitious methods through which they may be incorporated into the firm.
