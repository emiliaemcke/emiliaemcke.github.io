    <h1>Berger Ways of Seeing Response</h1>
    <div class="part1"> 
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>Perspective makes the eye the center of the world. The eye takes the world with it, it was difficult to think about appearances. The development of the camera changed the way in which we perceive objects. This made me think about how the development of the camera impacted art movements. Specifically, this reminded me of Mattisse’s piece of work Dance. At the beginning of the 1900s’ there was a period of upheaval, as well as well as the development of the camera. Matisse and other Fauves used bold colors in order to convey feelings. The distorted and loose figures in this piece, are also a unique and defining characteristic of this class of artists. They focused on motion in time and space to create dynamic and show quality of modern life. The fundamental nature of questioning can be seen in this piece.

        <h2>Nude Women</h2>
        <p>The second episode displays the way that women are portrayed in art. Though the women liberation movement destigmatized premarital sex
            and broke down certain notions of gender roles, there is still a unique story to be told about the way women are portrayed in art. One of the most famous figurative painters, Lucien Freud, painted his 14 year old daughter in the nude in a piece titles “Naked Child Laughing”.
